# Prerequisites

In order to write a plugin you need to write code. Sugarcube is developed with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) which allows you to develop applications using the JavaScript language. If you have never done so, you can ask someone else to write it for you or learn enough coding yourself to write the functionality you require.

If you need to review JavaScript, we recommend reading [this guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript). See [this website](https://github.com/vioan/nodejs-learning-resources) for more resources on learning coding and specifically NodeJS.

We’ll assume that you have some familiarity with JavaScript, but you should be able to follow along even if you’re coming from a different programming language. We’ll also assume that you’re familiar with programming concepts like functions, promises, objects and arrays.

Note that we’re also using some features from ES6 — a recent version of JavaScript. In this tutorial, we’re using [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) and [`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) statements.

To keep the guides simple, we will only be using features of JavaScript that are understood by NodeJS 10. Feel free to use a tool like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to enable the latest features of JavaScript.
