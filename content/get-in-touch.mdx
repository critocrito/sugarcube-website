# Get in Touch

We are the imperfect humans behind this piece of software.

A code person and an interface person.

The code person has a liking for programming languages yet complains a lot about the complexity of computers. While a cosmic pessimist at heart, he nevertheless builds tools for human rights defenders because it makes sense.

The Interface person had worn many hats in the past. Brand, marketing, creative director, UI, UX, moving slowly to front-end. Life goes on. She might nail one of those at the end or just retire because life is meaningless after all.

We have been collaborating for a few years. Our goal is the development of tools for the empowerment of human rights.
This is not a simulation. We are very serious about this.
We are aware there is a very very very long path in front of us.

Please reach out at sugarcubetools@protonmail.com. We want to hear from you.
