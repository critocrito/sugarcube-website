# Glossary

## Ncube

Based on a previsouly existing tool called Sugarcube, Ncube helps reasearchers to produce a set of verified data in order to make a statement about their area of research.

## Workspace

A workspace is a collection of sources, data units and investigation methodologies. A workspace can be either local or remote. The latter lives on a server to which you can connect, while the former exists on your computer.

## Source

A source is the location of one or several pieces of data. They tell processes where to look up up a particular piece of data in order to preserve it. Examples for a source are a Youtube channel, a Tweet or a website URL.

## Tag

Units of data can be tagged to mark them as being part of a category. The meaning of tags are up for the user but they can be used to sort and find related data. Tags can be attached to sources as well. Any unit that is fetched based on a source inherits the tag as well.

## Data

Individual pieces of data are called units of data. They represent a single thing that was fetched using a process. Sometimes a query maps to a single unit of data, but that's not necessarily always the case. When fetching a Tweet it forms a single unit of data, whereas a Youtube channel yields many units of data, one for each video that is part of the channel.

## Database

Every workspace has a single database. Any data that is fetched is stored in this one database.

## Segment

A segment is a narrow view into the database. It allows to codify repeated questions to the data of a workspace. A segment is based on a search query. Any unit that the search yields is part of the segment.

## Process

To fetch data for a source Ncube runs data processes based on Sugarcube. Each process fetches data from a different source or represents some other type of data process.

## Investigation

Based on a single database many types of investigations are possible, e.g. an investigation tries to answer a single question to the data or tries to make a statement about an event. One database can lead to many different investigations of different complexity and purpose.

## Methodology

The basis of an investigation forms a process of verification. Each investigations has a single verification methodology. Amethodology consists of

- a verification process, i.e. the stages of verification each piece of data has to pass through,
- and an annotation schema describing additional insights about some data.

Segments are added to an investigation, and are annotated and vetted in the process following the rules of the verification methodology. The goal of verification is to produce a set of data about which a statement can be made with high confidence of accuracy. Each research will likely require it's own methodology. Ncube is flexible enough to express many different methodologies.

## Verification Stage

A verification methodology is broken down into several stages. Each stage can represent a milestone in the overall verification or an element of the organizational structure of the investigation. Each stage can require different sets of annotations. Each unit of data can reach the next verification stage once it passed the current stage. Pushing data like this from one stage to another makes sure that data experiences the proper due dilligence.

## Annotation

Every data that is fetched by a process cannot be modified. But researchers can enhance the data by annotating existing data with new information. It is clearly visible which data is original and which data are annotations. Annotations can be freely added as part of a verification workflow.
