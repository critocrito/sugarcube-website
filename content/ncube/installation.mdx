# Installation

## Linux

The easiest way to install the desktop version of Ncube is to install one of the provided packages. Currently there are only `deb` packages for [Ubuntu 18.04](https://github.com/critocrito/ncube/releases/latest/download/ncube_ubuntu-18.04_amd64.deb) and [Ubuntu 20.04](https://github.com/critocrito/ncube/releases/latest/download/ncube_ubuntu-20.04_amd64.deb). For any other Linux distribution build Ncube [from source](#from-source).

Install the provided `deb` package by either double-clicking it in the file browser or using a terminal:

```sh
sudo dpkg -i ncube_ubuntu-20.04_amd64.deb
```

For Linux there are additional packages containing only the server component of Ncube. The server component packages start with `ncubed` in their name.
