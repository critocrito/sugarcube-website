# Get Started

The Discovery Web Extesnion is a browser plugin to send interesting links from the browser directly to [Ncube](/ncube) to queue up for preservation.

To install the Discovery Web Extension read the [installation instructions](/discovery/installation).

To get help about Ncube, the Discovery Web Extendsion, and data investigation methodologies, or to suggest new use cases and functionality, feel free to post on the [Sugarcube Tools community forum](https://users.sugarcubetools.net). Ncube is an imperfect software in an imperfect world. If you found that something wasn't working the way you expected it, please report it on the [Ncube issue tracker](https://github.com/critocrito/ncube/issues).
